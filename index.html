		One day Andrew and his
dog Rocky went for a walk.
They walked and walked. After a little bit, they
walked past a big tree.
Poof! Rocky was a robot dog.
“Woof, woof,” barked Rocky the robot dog.
“What is going on?” asked Andrew. “Who turned
my dog into a robot dog?”
Andrew looked all around him. He looked up the
street. He looked down the street. He looked
behind the tree. He looked up into the tree. No one
was there. He stopped and stood still.
“Hee, hee, hee,” he heard. It came from the
tree.
“Woof, woof,” barked Rocky the robot dog at the
tree.
Andrew looked at the tree. He could not see
anything different about this tree. He could not
think of what to do.
“Tree, are you a real tree?” asked Andrew. The
tree did not say anything. 
A Robot Dog 2
Rocky the robot dog came over and smelled the
tree.
“Woof, woof,” he barked at it again.
Andrew was mad. He did not like it that Rocky
was a robot dog. Andrew walked over to the tree and
tickled it.
“Stop that,” said the tree. “Why did you tickle
me?”</p>
